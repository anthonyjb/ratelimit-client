For any given state there are multiple things to call:

- enter()
- exit()
- input(key) > process input from the user in the form of a key press
- update(dt) > update the state based on the time that has ellapsed (unlikely to matter much here other than for basic animations)
- render() > render the state to the screen



The main UI will consist of 3 windows:

    - Message (height 1, margin-bottom 1)
    - Viewport (height max -2, margin-bottom 1)
    - Stats (height 1)


There will be other UIs such as the inventory, help screen, game set up screens,
etc.
